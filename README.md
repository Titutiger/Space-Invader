Steps for the game to work

These are the steps for the game to work –

First, download Pycharm (I have not tried it with the original python IDLE but for now please use Pycharm)

Create a new python project

Press the windows key and enter Pycharm,
Select the folder and open it – 
 
Find the project name and add the images by drag and drop or by copy and paste

 
(Ignore the other images)

Once done, you will see the files on your left
 

Then you can copy paste the code file or open it.

If there is a redline under any of the imports
 
Hover your curser there and click on the red bulb, after click on install for the import to e installed.

I need help for the sound affects and to make a platform where you will not need to install pycharm to use it.









After this, you can enter ctrl + shift + F10
This will run the code and enjoy the game.

Thank you.
